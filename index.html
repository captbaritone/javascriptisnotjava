<p>This may be difficult for some of you to accept, but JavaScript is not Java.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, both languages belong to the programming world. However, aside from this apparently confusing similarity, the two languages could not be further from the same thing. Back in 2009, web developer Jeremy Keith so <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1595" title="read this great article on differences between java and javascript">poignantly pointed out</a>, "Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster." </p>

<p>The confusion on these two words is a widely discussed and bemusing topic. "Technical" recruiters seem so confident that the two words are synonymous, they routinely attempt recruiting developers for the wrong field. Perhaps it's because both words utilize "java" in their titles.</p>

<p>I have, therefore, provided several additional comparisons to illustrate the differences between these two languages.</p>
